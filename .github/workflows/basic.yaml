# This is a basic workflow to get help you get started with GitHub Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the Workflow will run
on:
    # Triggers the Workflow on push or pull request Events but only for the "master" branch
    push:
        branches: ["master"]
    pull_request:
        branches: ["master"]

    # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A Workflow Run is made up of one or more Jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
    # This Job checks out the code from the repository
    checkout:
        # The type of Runner that the Job will run on
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        # Steps are a sequence of tasks executed as part of a Job
        steps:
            # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # This job does the core processing
    process:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
            # Runs a single command using the Runner's shell
            - name: Run a one-line script
              run: echo "Hello, world!"

            # Runs a set of commands using the Runner's shell
            - name: Run a multi-line script
              run: |
                  echo "Add other actions to build,"
                  echo "test, and deploy your project."
